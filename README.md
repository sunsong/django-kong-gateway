# django-kong-gateway

This is a project in my mind for quite peroid of time. I want to use kong as API Gateway for Django projects. This projects haven't started yet.

Features I'd like to implement:

- Cookie generated (encrypted) by kong instead of generated directly by django.
- Session id generated by kong
- A django admin model that can set & control the kong using kong admin.
- Cache enabling settings for urls of the django and allow config in django admin.
- SSL certificates stored in the django admin and set kong ssl config accordingly (with SNI support).
- Integrate with kong plugins. (Basic Authentication / Key Authentication / ACL consumer / CORS)
